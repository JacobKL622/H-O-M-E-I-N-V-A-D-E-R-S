HOME INVADERS


LORE
Own a musket for home defense, since that's what the founding fathers intended.
Four ruffians break into my house. "What the devil?" As I grab my powdered wig and Kentucky rifle.
Blow a gold ball sized hole through the first man, he's dead on the spot.
Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely because it's a smoothbore and nails the neighbor's dog.
I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot, 
"Tally ho lads" the grape shot shreds to of the men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off car alarms.
Fix bayonet and charge the last terrified rapscallion.
He bleeds out waiting on the police to arrive since triangular bayonet wounds are impossible to stitch up.
Just as the founding fathers intended.

GAME INSTRUCTIONS
You are Georgee, your average American citizen. Suddenly, during the night, several footsteps wake you up and you find at least 27 burglars within your home.
Use your furniture to protect yourself and fight back against waves of burglars of suspicously green variety (there's a lot of them for some reason). 
As your fight draws on, the home invaders become more and more powerful, becoming to harder hurt, chasing you throughout your home from the living room to the bathroom to the Lake of Rot. 

The night in long and the enemies numerous, but your ammunition is limitless (there was a deal at Kellogs).
Good luck Georgee, you're going to need it.
